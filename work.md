1. Treat yourself as a product that you need to sell. Understand the market and what it is demanding

1. In our current age of information overload and distractions, if you are able to stay focused on a
   "deep work"-state for slots of 1-3 hours, and you are able to have mental clarity you ahead of
   over the 1% of the population.

1. Being able to sit down for 1h reading a book without distractions is currently a super power.

1. Doncic Law: The moment something is for sale, its price immediately goes down. When the Mavericks
   decided to sell Luka Doncic, his perceived value dropped significantly, which if they would have
   waited for people to approach them, they could have gotten a much better deal. This is a reminder
   to never disclose that you are open to offers or in the market to explicitly to try and increase
   your perceived value. This will land you better offers.
