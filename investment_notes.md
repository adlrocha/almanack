# Investment notes

## Basics

### What is investment.
- Benjamin Graham: "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative"
  - One needs to have a security margin and analyse the investment to be sure that it is capable of returning the principle.
- Long-term investments means that stocks shouldn't be rotated too often.
  - We are incentivised to buy and sell often because financial intermediaries earn fees for every transaction, so they want to maximise it (worth considering as one invests).


### Speculators v.s. Investors
- Investors should understand the intrinsic value of a company (e.g. by analysing the present discounted cash flows).
  - Companies will make money in the future to investors. The goal of investments is to understand if the price of the company in the market is below its real value (Analogy with the 50 euros bill: it could be priced 70 or 30. Speculators would buy as long as they think it will go up, but investors would analyse the real price --50-- and only buy if the price is below that).\
- __Investors prevent losses__ (this is key and something that we don't usually do).
- Investors focus on the difference between value and price
- The result of an investment are dividends, re-buy of stocks, interest payments, reinvestments.
- Metals and Crypto are speculation not investments because you can't analyse their intrinsic value.

### Simple and Compound interest
```
n = time period
r = interest rate

# Simple interest
Final Capital = Initial Capital * (1 + n*r)
# Compound interest
Final Capital = Initial Capital (1 + i) ^ n
```
- The 72 Rule: If you get an interest rate of x% you can compute the amount of time required to double your capital by doing `72 / interest rate`

### Opportunity cost
- Every time you make a big expense, one should think if this is the best use of the money compared to the second best option (like investing it). Is this offering you the life improvements that you were looking for?
  - This is why investors sometimes are considered "frugal", in every decision they consdier their opportunity cost.
- Compute future value of money.
  - Considering n as the interest from the investment.
```
Future value = Present value * (1 + i) ^ 5
```
- This is the future value that should be considered for every investment.
- The minimum interest rate that should be considered for stock investments is of 9% (considering inflation values and risks).
  ```
- Compute future value
  - Considering n as the inflation rate
```
Present Value = Future value / (1 + i) ^ n
```
- Expected return on capital considering the initial and final values to understand the opportunity costs.
```
i = (( Final value / Present value ) ^ (1/n)) - 1
```

### Expected profit and black swans
- If you analyse historical returns of stock markets, you'll realise that they don't behave exactly as a Gaussian as expected in the efficient market theory, but that the left (negative) tails of the Gaussian are heavier, meaning that black swans are likely to occur pushing more negative returns in the short-term. These tend to be compensated with slightly higher returns in the average of the curve.
  - This is why for long-term investors black swans are an opportunity.
  - Long-term investors focus on the difference between prices and intrinsic value. Not every investor is rational.

### Risk and how to minimise it.
- Diversify (to minimise volatility).
  - Diversify in markets, asset allocation, investment philosophies --value, growth, etc.-- ...
- Buy with a security margin.
- Focus on your circle of competence 
  - Understand what are your limits.
  - Focus first on the companies that you've used extensively, and the sector that you work or that you know well.
  - It's all about patience.
- Find opportunities when the market is full of fear, and stay vigilant when there's euphoria in the market.

> Note: Focus your portfolio with a percentage following the index, and the rest in a small number of good bets to enhance the expected return.

> Note: Keep the thesis for the companies and markets that I want to invest with the target price and wait for the crash to invest when the prices go down.

## Financial Planning
> One should always have 1-year of emergency fund in (strict) liquidity before investing to protect themselves against crisis and unexpected situations.
> - That way you will not need to liquidate your investment in the worst possible case (which is potentially when you'll need it).

- Financial planning is all about defining your investor profile (in terms of risks), and your investment goals.
  - In my case I am a long-term investor that is able to handle risk well (crypto, you know?). And the goals I am after by investing are: __financial freedom, safety, and knowledge__
- Depending on your age your investment goals and asset allocation may (and will) change.

> When in retirement, or at the end of your investment life, it would be good to not liquidate __over a 3% of your total assets__ to prevent from harming the effects of compound interest.

- Always teach financial education to your kids. Give them the tools to protect their net worth, and grow it.
  - If you end up leaving them with some assets, this will ensure that they know how to handle them and grow them.

### Personal Balance Sheet
- Asset: What you have
- Liabilities: What you owe (debt)
- Net Worth: The final balance (savings)

- Liabilities are used to finance the assets
- It may be useful to understand the short-term and long-term liabilities to understand the balance.
```
Example:
Assets
==
Cash  = 2000 
Car = 8000 
Home = 150000
Investment = 10000

Liabilities
==
Mortgage = 80000

Net Worth
==
Net Worth = 61000
```

- To understand the savings and cash flow of the house. The savings go immediately to net worth
```
Income
---
Expenses
---
Savings     ------> Net worth.
```
- Savings should be invested to profit yourself and protect against inflation (i.e. economical freedom)

> Your saving rates should be ideally >20% of your income.

- The Free Cash Flow is the liquidity that you have available after all your expenses.
- Assets should be productive. Try to avoid unproductive assets.
- Your own house could be considered a toxic asset because it doesn't make profit and its value may go down.
- Focus on profitable assets and increase your income.

### Financial Instruments
- Bank deposits
- Guaranteed funds: Investment funds that ensure a specific rate.
  - High fees
- Saving insurances: Guaranteed rate, but is low.
- Public debt (government debt)
- Corporate debt: Higher rate than public debt
  - Index funds and ETF is a good way to access corporate debt
- Mixed investment funds
- Equity investment funds
- Stocks
  - In many cases it may be better than investing in investment funds and you can minimise the risk if you have analyse the stocks you invest in (through the price/intrinsic value of the stock security margin)
- Commodities
  - Usually through investment funds

### Savings
> Pay yourself first. - Kiyosaky

> To become rich there are only to things: work and savings. - Benjamin Franklin

- Credit expansions impact your savings (in the current economic model).

### Credit expansion v.s. true savings
- What happens when there is a credit expansion?
 1. Increases the price of the source production factors.
  - Prices increase closer to the consumer and therefore reduce the incentive of being farther from it.
  - Companies can use credit to finance them.
 2. Consumer product prices increase because the demand increases.
  - Artificial profits on consumer corporations because it is financed by credits and people don't buy only what they need.
 3. Increase the price on consumer products but salaries and productive factors do not increase.
  - Worker productivity is not rewarded when there are credit expansions
  - Consumer corporations like Amazon,
 4. Ricardo effect.
  - "Salaries should be estimated through their real value, i.e. the amount of work and capital used to produce them, not by their nominal value in coats, hats or money"
  - Consumer products and assets increase their prices while salaries do not increase as much.
  - Businessmen are incentivised to hire cheap labour.
 5. Interest rates go up.
  - Reverted after the crisis.
  - With high rates there is a fight for liquidity among the economic agents.
 6. Losses on corporations that are farther from the consumer (e.g. commodities, industry, etc.)
  - They are really leveraged and they can't refinance their debt.
- Credit expansions only incentivise first-order products because there is short-term thinking. There is no investment in productivity boots (through machinery, investing on improvements, etc.).
  

> Book recommendation: "Dinero, credito bancario y ciclos econÃ³micos" - Huerta de Soto

- Financing your own personal assets through credit expansion makes you vulnerable to the macroeconomic landscape and the economic cycle.
  - Buying assets through savings can shield you against this effect (to some extent)
  - An excess of leverage is risky.

> Do not get debt for non-lasting products (cars, houses that only produce losses, luxury, travelling, etc.)

> Invest on day 1 of the month to pay yourself first (your savings first)

## Economic foundations
- Corporations are entities that arbitrate with scarcity.
  - They take low-value assets and commodities, and transform them into high-value consumer products that are fulfilling a need.
- Analysing demand and supply elasticity is key to understand how a product (or company) can be impacted by the different economic cycles and consumer behaviors.
![Elasticity : Elasticity of Demand | Definition | Economics | Formula ...](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-puYbHIf7ZGo%2FXL1DgCbc-TI%2FAAAAAAAABrs%2FFIDy84ZapyQNtnkxh5r0vEHjBLIXpPqfwCLcBGAs%2Fs1600%2FPrice-Elasticity-of-Demand-Curve.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=662b40e738260732622451c34f36c9348131db95b5e9ecb905e389e5e6d85b08&ipo=images)
![Using the Supply-and-Demand Framework](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsaylordotorg.github.io%2Ftext_microeconomics-theory-through-applications%2Fsection_11%2Ffc29ff534ed9caa47f3a4a6c101bbea0.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=c13de0b8c574487160f97508f1e422f212f667042c2ad7e2824b0ae0007a4bb7&ipo=images)
- It is important to understand that corporations do not determine the price of their products depending on their costs. __Generally, they try to adjust their costs according to the price they can ask for their product__.
  - On top of this, buyers will determine the intrinsic value (and utility) that this product brings them (that should be higher than their price for the product to be bought)

### Lifecycle of technological product
- Ideally, one should invest when some technology has just crossed the chasm and the pragmatists are starting to use it.
- Many people have made themselves rich investing in companies that haven't yet crossed the chasm (generally startups), but one incurs in way more risk.

### Natural and legislative monopolies
- Natural monopolies are great investments (as long as there is no regulation cutting their wings).
  - Generally these monopolies are achieved through innovation, technology, know-how, and business disruption.
  - This monopolies foster the competition from other players that want to disrupt the current big players.
- Legislative monopolies require the state to continue their status and they are not as efficient and innovative (as there is no competition).

### Macroeoconomic indicators
- Economic cycles shouldn't be studied through debt, but the liquidity in the system.
  - Liquidity determines if debt can be paid with current cash flows.
- Main macroeconomic indicators: These are useful to understand the environment (and country) where we are investing:

  - Credit supply
    - Central bank balance (expansive or restrictive policy)
    - Long-term or short-term debt given to governments and banks.
    - Balance of commercial banks.
    - Are new bank reserves being created and money being issued?
    - Bank reserve rates.
    - There are webs that allow you to inspect this.

  - Credit demand
    - Demand for credits from families and corporations.
    - Percentage of mortgages costs for families.
    - Late payments and defaults.

  - Interest rate
    - Long-term and short-term interest rate.
    - The rate curve, and understand if it has been inverted.
      - Arbitrage is possible when the rate from the short-term and the long-term is really close.
      - The interest rate should be higher always in the long-term.
      - The inversion of the curve happens when there is an extreme search of liquidity by all economic agents.
      - The interest rate should also be increasing (if not something weird is happening).
    - What is the different between public and private debt.

  - Activity and expectations
    - GDP
    - Expenses in construction
    - Retail sales
    - Industrial incomes
    - And any other metric that is related to the economic activity of a country or a region.

  - Employment: It gives some insights about the health of the economy
    - Unemployment rate
    - Employment costs for companies.
    - Rate of occupation.
    - Salaries increases.

  - Price and costs (CPI)
    - Inflation rate or deflation
    - Price per square meter.
    - Case Schiller index and GDP
    - Index marketcap and prices, PER, EV/EBITDA multiples, asset prices, etc.
    - Stocks evolution

  - External balances (exchange rates, etc.)
    - Imports and exports.
    - Exchange and currency rates.
    - External balance.

  - Public/State finances
    - State budgets.
    - Regulation security. Market freedom.
    - Total debt of the state

### Economic cycle
> Understood through the degradation of liquidity (Juan RamÃ³n Rallo)
- Boom (liquidity degradation): Less liquidity by agents.
  - A lot of mortgages and credit. A lot of long-term leverage.
  - Cheap debt leads to a lot of credit and more long-term debt.
  - Unemployment close to zero.
  - Prices go up and lasting assets increase their price.
  - Individuals are reckless and start making a lot of bad decisions.

- Crisis (fight for liquidity): Less liquidity supply.
  - From boom to depression. They fight for debt. Banks harm their balances and is full or risk and they have to limit their leverage.
  - Debt is given to people that are more risky (everyone else may have debt).
  - Interest rates in the short-term go up and there is an inversion.
  - GDP is still high, but expectations start going up.
  - Unemployment starts raising at industries farther from consumers.
  - Prices don't go up as much.
  - In this stage people do not yet realise that a crisis is coming and there may be a problem coming.

- Liquidation (depression): The actual crisis, with defaults, unemployment, etc.
  - The actual crisis.
  - Refinance and deleverage. This leads to the sell-off of many assets to get liquidity.
  - The debt supply goes down and there are a lot of defaults, and banks balances are really impacted (and dome may die).
  - Savings start going up in order to deleverage.
  - Unemployment go up. 
  - Interest rates go down because the demand for liquidity goes down.
  - This is why liquidity is useful in this stage.
  - Prices start going down.
  - Public states start being harmed and there may be risks of defaults for countries. 
    - Lot of debt and taxes go down.

- Recapitalisation (recovery): Agents start deleveraging and the economy recovers
  - Credit offer raise again and many entities have de-leveraged.
  - Prices start going up after the liquidations from the previous stage.
  - GDP starts going up.
  - Expectations increase.
  - Unemployment start going down again.

> Always have some liquidity available when the liquidation stage is approaching.

  > These is an Austrian approach for the economic cycle, but this hasn't been the case lately where central banks are injecting a lot of liquidity to banks when indicators glimpse a crisis. The issue with drowning with liquidity the economy is that it "zombifies" it (like it has happened in Japan in the last few decades).

### Juglar Cycles and Kondratieff Seasons

  ![Distribution of Kondratiev, Kuznets, Juglar and Kitchen cycles ...](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FIvo-Yotsov%2Fpublication%2F372287971%2Ffigure%2Ffig1%2FAS%3A11431281174113035%401689139034173%2FDistribution-of-Kondratiev-Kuznets-Juglar-and-Kitchen-cycles.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=bf71fcc79fa6c5017bee174618675ba8e28f926c61ed8d439ed262fba3f16e41&ipo=images)
  ![Ciclos de Kondratieff](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftodoproductosfinancieros.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F10%2Fmedium.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=5b41e921650ee1bebdf34cf7c1ea67e1398a35b7ef9c185e67fa2dce7255646e&ipo=images)
  - Joseph Schumpeter said that there were several simultaneous economic cycles.
    - Kitchin Cycle: 3 years

    - Juglar Cycle: 10 years (business cycle)
      - Availability of assets (i.e. liquidity)
      - Similar to the liquidity cycles from Juan RamÃ³n Rallo.
      - Spread between high-quality and low-quality credit starts being harmed when the cycles is ending
        - Credit curve inverts.
      - Similar seasons and indicators as in the liquidity seasons.

    - Kondratieff cycle: 50-60 years (4 seasons of around 15 years)
      - Long-term economic cycles.
      - ~ 2 Juglar cycles per season
      - He came up with these by studying macroeconomic indicators.
        - He realised prices and interest rates was what impacts more the economic cycles and the change of "cycle seasons"
      - Summer (estanflation)
      - Autumn (desinflation)
        - Autumn is the best season to invest in the stock market.
      - Winter (deflation): Bad season for stock markets. It start surfacing some companies defaults. Prices go down, interest rates go down.
      - Spring (reflation): Also a good season for the stock market. Prices start going up and there is monetary stimulus from public administrations.
        - This leads to the zombification of the economy because there is a lot of monetary stimulus.

## Passive Investment
