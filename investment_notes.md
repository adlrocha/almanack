# Investment notes

## Basics
- Benjamin Graham: "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative"
  - One needs to have a security margin and analyse the investment to be sure that it is capable of returning the principle.
- Long-term investments means that stocks shouldn't be rotated too often.
  - We are incentivised to buy and sell often because financial intermediaries earn fees for every transaction, so they want to maximise it (worth considering as one invests).
