# Investment notes

## Basics

### What is investment.
- Benjamin Graham: "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative"
  - One needs to have a security margin and analyse the investment to be sure that it is capable of returning the principle.
- Long-term investments means that stocks shouldn't be rotated too often.
  - We are incentivised to buy and sell often because financial intermediaries earn fees for every transaction, so they want to maximise it (worth considering as one invests).


### Speculators v.s. Investors
- Investors should understand the intrinsic value of a company (e.g. by analysing the present discounted cash flows).
  - Companies will make money in the future to investors. The goal of investments is to understand if the price of the company in the market is below its real value (Analogy with the 50 euros bill: it could be priced 70 or 30. Speculators would buy as long as they think it will go up, but investors would analyse the real price --50-- and only buy if the price is below that).\
- __Investors prevent losses__ (this is key and something that we don't usually do).
- Investors focus on the difference between value and price
- The result of an investment are dividends, re-buy of stocks, interest payments, reinvestments.
- Metals and Crypto are speculation not investments because you can't analyse their intrinsic value.

### Simple and Compound interest
```
n = time period
r = interest rate

# Simple interest
Final Capital = Initial Capital * (1 + n*r)
# Compound interest
Final Capital = Initial Capital (1 + i) ^ n
```
- The 72 Rule: If you get an interest rate of x% you can compute the amount of time required to double your capital by doing `72 / interest rate`

### Opportunity cost
- Every time you make a big expense, one should think if this is the best use of the money compared to the second best option (like investing it). Is this offering you the life improvements that you were looking for?
  - This is why investors sometimes are considered "frugal", in every decision they consdier their opportunity cost.
- Compute future value of money.
  - Considering n as the interest from the investment.
```
Future value = Present value * (1 + i) ^ 5
```
- This is the future value that should be considered for every investment.
- The minimum interest rate that should be considered for stock investments is of 9% (considering inflation values and risks).
  ```
- Compute future value
  - Considering n as the inflation rate
```
Present Value = Future value / (1 + i) ^ n
```
- Expected return on capital considering the initial and final values to understand the opportunity costs.
```
i = (( Final value / Present value ) ^ (1/n)) - 1
```

### Expected profit and black swans
- If you analyse historical returns of stock markets, you'll realise that they don't behave exactly as a Gaussian as expected in the efficient market theory, but that the left (negative) tails of the Gaussian are heavier, meaning that black swans are likely to occur pushing more negative returns in the short-term. These tend to be compensated with slightly higher returns in the average of the curve.
  - This is why for long-term investors black swans are an opportunity.
  - Long-term investors focus on the difference between prices and intrinsic value. Not every investor is rational.

### Risk and how to minimise it.
- Diversify (to minimise volatility).
  - Diversify in markets, asset allocation, investment philosophies --value, growth, etc.-- ...
- Buy with a security margin.
- Focus on your circle of competence 
  - Understand what are your limits.
  - Focus first on the companies that you've used extensively, and the sector that you work or that you know well.
  - It's all about patience.
- Find opportunities when the market is full of fear, and stay vigilant when there's euphoria in the market.

> Note: Focus your portfolio with a percentage following the index, and the rest in a small number of good bets to enhance the expected return.

> Note: Keep the thesis for the companies and markets that I want to invest with the target price and wait for the crash to invest when the prices go down.
