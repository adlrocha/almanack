# Finance and Economics
> A compendium of principles and lessons learned about finance and economics.

1. Save and invest since an early age. If you don't make huge mistakes and you manage risk the compound interest will do the rest for you.

1. Manage risk and minimise your losses. Invest in assets that you understand and that you are convinced about the theses behind them. That way you won't panic when the market goes down. Noob investors tend to behave when they face their first bear market like a diver that has a problem when they are deep underwater: they tend to go up too fast and they can get hurt and lose conscience. The best way to avoid this is to have a plan and stick to it.

1. Diversify your investments. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

1. Always invest the money that you don't need, and invest in assets in a way that will allow you to sleep at night.

1. Prices are not determined by utility, but by the demand pressure over scarce resources. This is why the _“Bitcoin doesn’t have an intrinsic value”_ or _“gold doesn’t generate any productive output”_ are not valid theses. A glass of water has more utility than a bullion of gold but, depending on the context, water is not scarce. Generally, one would pay more for gold than water because it is scarce, unless you are in the desert, where the dynamics may change. This is a good way of thinking about prices when investing.

1. There are several types of inflation, and it is really important to be able to identify them. The most common ones are: **Monetary inflation**, when the money supply increases, the value of the currency decreases. This is the most common type of inflation and the one that most people refer to when they talk about inflation; and **Price inflation**, when the price of goods and services increases. This is the type of inflation that most people are concerned about, as it affects their purchasing power.

1. On monetary inflation: the effect of issuing more FIAT money (through central bank policies, government debts, or commercial bank deposits) is the same as when investors holding stocks are diluted after a new round of investment. When you hold FIAT, you are implicitly an investor on that currency, and you can be diluted by the central bankers, commercial banks, and/or states that control it.

1. When investing in stocks as a financial instrument think of them broadly speaking as bonds, that generate future cash flows yearly. The company that you invest in should be capable of maintaining this bond-like behavior long-term.

1. Debt is not bad (without it we wouldn't have the global prosperity that we are experiencing), but excess of debt is risky. Even an excess of capital can be risky because it leads to bad decisions. Having money without knowing what to do with it leads to bad decisions.

1. "It pays to build up savings in the good times so there are savings to draw on in the bad times. There are costs to having too much savings as well as too little savings, and no one gets the balance exactly right." - Ray Dalio

1. If debts are denominated in a country’s own currency, its central bank can and will “print” the money to alleviate the debt crisis. This allows them to manage it better than if they couldn't print the money, but of course it also reduces the value of the money. If the debt is not denominated in currencies that their central banks can print, then they will have debt defaults and deflationary depressions measured in the currency that they owe and can’t print.
