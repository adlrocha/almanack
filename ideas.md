# Random Ideas

> List of random ideas that I am hoping to one day implement (or for someone to take them from me

### Exposing your broker through MCP

- Letting your MCP access to your portfolio and the search engine of the available assets in your
  brokers helping you implement your strategy with its help.

### Open-source Rewind / Clueley

Source: https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1934328852261814721 I've lost countless hours of my live
because I couldn't "go back" to something I wrote or heard in the past. For example:

"where is that file where I implemented FFT with Î»-encodings...?"

or even

"what was that product that was like a super dental floss?"

I have 1000's of partial experiments scattered all around several directories. Not every experiment
or thought is worth making a repository or post for. So, going back to that exact thing that's on my
mind is, sometimes, really hard.

I've now learned there was a product called "Rewind" that attempts to solve that exact problem. But,
being a closed source startup, nobody knows for how long it'll stay afloat, and this is a long-term
project.

So, I think I might spend a day or two building that thing in Rust. Take a screenshot of your
computer every minute or so, heavily compress, OCR it, build a vector db or something, and then let
you semantically search for anything from your past... basically the ultimate human memory
augmenter.

### Safety Map

- Data pipeline with the security of neighborhoods and streets in big cities.
- Map (and Google Maps overlay) with their level of security.
- Overlay over Google Maps?

### Sources of inspiration for side-projects

- https://www.financialdatasets.ai/
- P2P DuckDB: https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-duck
- Stablecoins. Build upon the thesis of stablecoins becoming the collateral of the world instead of
  T-Bills. The liquidity spread of stablecoins and FIAT among networks and the need to optimise
  routing them according to use and maximising yield of idle cash.
