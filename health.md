1. Sleeping is the most important activity that you can do to stay health and recover your body. Even above working out. If you have to choose between having high-quality sleep for >8 hours or sacrificing an hour of sleep to workout, choose sleeping.
  - Naps are a good way to recover from a bad night of sleep. Allow yourself to go to bed throughout the day (as long as you don't impact your next night sleep).

1. Avoid gluten, alcohol and sugar, and always stand up from the table after meals with some hunger. By eating 30% less we would be able to avoid 30% of the current cancers being diagnosed. Even more, gluten will be consider in the near future a drug as bad a sugar or alcohol.
