# Mental Models
> A collection of mental models and ways to think about the world that I find useful in my daily life.
1. Physics teaches you how reality works, rational investing teaches you how the society works.

1. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it buys freedom. And freedom can buy happiness. Owning your time can be the most valuable asset you can have.

1. Time is the most scarce resource you have. Use it wisely!

1. Life is hard, and it is not fair. The sooner you accept this, the better off you'll be, but it is worth every second of it.

1. Write a diary and meditate. It will help you understand yourself better and make better decisions. Like saving and investing your money, these are habits that compound.

1. Some habits are compounding, and you need to persist to see the results. If you think they are good for you, stick to them.

1. Purchasing your own domain name is like getting your own personal piece of the Internet. It is like buying a piece of land in the digital world. It gives you ownership over your email address, your website, and all the services that you build, removing the vendor lock-in that we see in current web2.0 platform and services.

1. On investing, inflation and generational inequalities: The world has been playing monopoly for hours and you just joined the game. No wonder why everything seems more challenging and expensive, everyone has hotels in the board, and you keep having to pay for them. The sooner you enter the game, the better off youâ€™ll be! This is why baby boomers (our parents) had easier access to housing and jobs, and why millennials are struggling to get a foot in the door. The game has been going on for a while, and the rules are not fair for everyone. It is not fair, so the best you can do is to learn the rules and play the game as best as you can with the card that you've been given.
 
1. Find your purpose in life. Purpose will drive your happiness and help you make the right decisions. Let this be have kids and make a family, solve a problem that you are passionate about, or reach financial independence. Find your purpose and let it guide you.

1. _"Invert, always invert"_. Sometimes the hard problems in life need to be solved from the other side.
