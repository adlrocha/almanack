- Environments are a key asset to train AIs through RL. The closer the training environment is to the real one, the better it will end up operating. In the coming years I expect the programming of RL environments for AI to be as important as wiring the agents themselves (esp. for robotics and real world --analogous and flawed environments--). See [prime intellect's](https://www.primeintellect.ai/) RL environments as the seed for this trend.
